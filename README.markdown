## What is it?

A simple build system written using VBScript, Windows Batch files and Windows 
scripting host. 

## But why?

Well, like most applications, it was written to scratch an itch. I have several
projects at work that utilize Microsoft (R) Office databases and spreadsheets.
These are projects that have grown over time, but the business is still not
willing to rewrite as proper applications. They have still become complex 
enough that I see the need for a build system. Most build systems, however, are
geared towards actual compiled (or interpretted) code bases. In this case, I 
need something that can handle some basic Office automation. 

## Is this really that useful?

Probably not. But then again, it is really only being written for a couple of 
projects I have at work that have very basic needs. If someone else finds it 
useful, though, please let me know.

## How do I use it?

It is really very simple. Just check out the 
[How to Use WshScript](http://wiki.github.com/hsteinhilber/WshBuild/how-to-use-wshbuild)
page at [GitHub](http://github.com).
